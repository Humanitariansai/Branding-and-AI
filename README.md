# **Part 1: The Critique**

### **1. The "Humanitarian" Gap**

  * **The Issue:** The original outline looks like a standard corporate branding course. It discusses "Competitor Analysis" and "Customers."
  * **The Fix:** Humanitarian branding is different. It is about **Donors, Beneficiaries, and Volunteers.** It relies on *empathy*, *trust*, and *transparency*, not just "sales." The updated course must reflect **"Impact Branding"**—how to brand a mission, not just a product.

### **2. "Labs First" Implementation**

  * **The Issue:** The pedagogy claims "Labs First," but the original outline lists "Topics" first and "Labs" second for every module.
  * **The Fix:** In the update below, I have flipped the structure. You will see the **"Build" (Lab)** assignment first. This ensures you start the week creating, then use the theory to refine what you built.

### **3. Sequencing of Personal Branding**

  * **The Issue:** Personal Branding was Module 8.
  * **The Fix:** If you are a volunteer "learning by teaching," you need to establish your *own* credibility earlier. I have integrated personal branding elements throughout, but specifically moved the "Professional Identity" focus slightly earlier so you can use it to showcase your work from the course as you go.
